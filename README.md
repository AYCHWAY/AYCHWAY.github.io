===============

See OSM edits happen in real time.

This code is deployed and running here:
http://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/

You can restrict it to viewing only edits within a specified bounding-box like so:
http://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/#32.55,-15.82,71.65,44.65

Build a bounding box URL like that, using this page:
http://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/bbox.html
